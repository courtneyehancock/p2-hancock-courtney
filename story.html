          <h2>THE BEGINNING</h2>
          <p>A long time ago at the beginning of a forever love story, Sheri and David Hancock visited a craft show in the mountains of Tennessee. Sheri saw all sorts of items she wanted; however, riding on the budget of a teacher and deputy, Sheri and David couldn't possibly afford all the handmade merchandise being presented before them. So naturally, being the handy husband that he is, David came home to try and replicate the crafts his wife had seen and wanted at the show. The first craft he made was a heart shadow box shelf, which, she fell in love with. That one box began years of David making whatever Sheri drew or described for him. Friends saw what he had made and asked for pieces of their own. Friends of friends wanted larger items, like tables, cabinets and other furniture. Word of mouth requests kept his workshop busy.</p>

          <h2>AND TODAY</h2>
          <p>Still a full-time deputy, David enjoys creating things in his workshop on his days off. For pleasure and enjoyment, the Hancock family has decided to start a small backyard business, <strong>Dave's Wood Lab</strong>, to help showcase David and Sheri's work to those who could potentially want handcrafted materials made with love. The name of the business derives from three former, very special, members of the Hancock clan: Annie-Belle, Perseus Maximus, & Daisy May, three yellow Labradors who found themselves hanging out in David's workshop from time-to-time. </p>
